Repo for 2D Map Gen algorithm SOURCE CODE

(for the application see [https://github.com/justin-oxford/nations-app])
This app has only been tested on Windows 10.

This is a simple C++/SFML application which generates a 2D World Map in the same style as Civ 1.

I turned this forum post into code, using this post as a loose guide.

This is only the map-gen code, and will not compile on its own. For the full project code, please contact me: http://justinoxford.com/
